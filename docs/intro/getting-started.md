title: Getting Started

# **Warning: Doc out of date; below is for v1 (preserved for v2 inspiration)**

The following documentation will get you started with a new project, prompt the use of any requirements to run a new design system, explain what the files of your starting directory are doing for you, as well as take you through the steps of building a new component so you can really hit the ground running. 🏃 Let's get started!

> Note: Knapsack requires Node.js 8 or higher, and PHP 7 - though only for the php cli, and not the ability to serve full php sites (i.e. PHP CGI nor Apache is needed).

### Initialize a new project

No need to create a new directory! In your terminal, run the following commands, replacing `my-design-system` with the name of your design system:

```bash
npm create knapsack my-design-system
cd my-design-system
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` is going to compile, and then start all watches on your local server. Make sure that PORT 3999 is availble. Than open https://localhost:3999 to see your design system dashboard.

### Output

After running the setup commands Knapsack will create a directory inside the current folder. In that directory, it will generate the initial project file structure:

```
my-design-system
├── assets
|   └── patterns
├── data
├── design-tokens
├── docs
├── public
|   ├── assets
|   └── images
├── dockerfile
├── knapsack.config.js
├── now.json
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── readme.md
```

Now that we have our dashboard up let's take a look at how we can customize it with the browser's user interface to fit the style of our new project.
