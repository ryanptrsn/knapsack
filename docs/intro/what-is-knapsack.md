title: What is Knapsack?

@todo

> "The **knapsack problem** is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items." ~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem)

We view the modern knapsack problem in front end web development as the careful curation of components; those perfectly crafted to bring the biggest bang for the buck. Users deserve a fast, clear experience and creators want to deliver value efficiently. Across the multitude of mediums of digital content from web sites to applications, many messages desire similar forms of branded, consistent UI delivery of that value.

### A nod to Knapsack's history, Bedrock

Due to reasons that were upsetting at the time but are funny in retrospect, our open-source design system tool needed a new name.

A lengthy bulleted list of names was compiled over a few weeks by the entire team, devs and non-devs. We paired 68-ish names down to 5. Our core focuses were: patterns, nature, architecture, memorability & catchiness, and spell-ability. Those names were then filtered by a thorough SEO & trademark search via Google, Github, & NPM.

Moving from the seemingly perfect name, "bedrock," the team was split between two less perfect options in "swatch" and "imprint." These were fine, but we weren't rallying behind them enthusiastically.

A war room meeting was scheduled. All-hands. 1 hour. The final naming gauntlet.

Two remained standing. Would it be "base layer?" Would it be "knapsack?" Knapsack came out victorious.
